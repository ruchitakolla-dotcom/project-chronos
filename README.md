## 🧩 Project Description
**Project Chronos** is an AI-powered *digital archaeologist* that reconstructs incomplete or obscure text fragments from old web archives.

It uses **Google Gemini AI** to:
- Reconstruct fragmented or slang-filled text  
- Fill in missing context and restore meaning  

It then uses **DuckDuckGo Search** to:
- Find related web pages, definitions, and historical explanations  

The program generates a **Reconstruction Report** that includes:
1. The original fragment  
2. The AI-reconstructed text  
3. Links to contextual web sources
